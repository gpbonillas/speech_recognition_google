Flutter has a lot of widgets to help with explicit animations,

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,076
ones that you, the developer, code up.

5
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,668
But there are also widgets for implicit animations,

6
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,957
those that animate changes for you.

7
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:20,655
A good one to know is <i>AnimatedContainer</i>.

8
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:24,346
You can build it once with a particular attribute, like color.

9
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,778
And when you rebuild it with a different value,

10
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:29,169
say, in response to a <i>setState</i> call,

11
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,057
<i>AnimatedContainer</i> performs a linear interpolation

12
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,385
between the two values.

13
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:34,865
And it's more than just colors.

14
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:38,716
You can animate borders, border radii, background images,

15
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:41,376
shadows, gradients, shapes, padding, width, height,

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,434
alignment, transforms, and more.

17
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:46,496
The length of the animation is controlled by the duration parameter,

18
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:49,597
and you can also specify your own curve to customize the effect.

19
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,138
There are a bunch of other widgets to help with implicit animations, too.

20
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,778
So head to <i>flutter.io</i> for more info.
